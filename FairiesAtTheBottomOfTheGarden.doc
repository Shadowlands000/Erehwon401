"My daughter says we have fairies at the bottom of our garden, and she talks with them. Isn't that wonderful?" The speaker, Gwen, was a plumpish woman in her late thirties with bottle blonded hair. She looked around the group, basking in murmured comments
 of approval.
\par How bizarre, Elanor thought. But then, English
 people did a number of strange things. Elanor was keenly aware that she was the only African in a group of nine women and four men. The group was supposed to be studying wicca, the old religion, and learning a healthy respect for anything that lurked at 
their gardens. Africans would be a lot more wary, but then this group seemed to be mostly bored housewives and a couple of weird guys.
\par "Really?" That was Mifunwi, the group's high priestess, and Elanor's personal friend. Mifunwi was a petite woman with milk
 pale skin, long hair dark as a raven's wing, and startlingly green eyes. She looked about thirty, but she had looked that age ten years ago when she and Elanor first met.
\par "Have you seen them yourself?" Mifunwi continued. "Do you know what they look like? Do you know what your daughter talks with them about?"
\par "Er, no." Gwen was deflated. "She tells me she plays with them. She says they look like in the pictures - you know, pretty little things with wings, and glowing with light."
\par "Ah, I see. Things are often not what they seem. I think I should meet these beings for myself. When would be convenient? It should be a time when your daughter is home, and when she normally would play with them."
\par "Oh, that would be after school, or the weekend. But my partner's home then, and he doesn't like Mary talking about fairies. He doesn't approve."
\par "Mmm, then we will be round friday afternoon. Best do this before the weekend."
\par "Er, I have a hair appointment then."
\par "Will Mary be home?" Mifunwi wasn't dissuaded. "We'll drop around before you leave." That was settled.
\par As they were leaving, Mifunwi turned to Elanor. "Elanor, I'd like you to come with me on friday. I feel something is going to happen that afternoon, and you will be needed."

\par }\pard \ql \fi143\li0\ri0\sa120\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\f27\fs20 Mifunwi drove a silver Mercedes with black leather interior. "Did you know anything of this?" she asked Elanor as they set off.
\par "No, I don't know Gwen all that well. Her Mary is about the same age as my Leah, I know that much."
\par "Mmm. You and I know that these things probably aren't harmless. They have a reason for befriending a child."
\par "I didn't grow up here, I'm not sure what fairies are." She agreed Mifunwi's assessment though.
\par "The legends tell of beings with magical powers. They were a separate people from humans, long lived, short, with
 elongated heads. But that covers many folk, from elves, pixies, goblins and so on. The fairies have a reputation for stealing children, and they can make put a glamour on themselves to make them appealing to humans. The legends also tell of adults who've
 gone to dance with the fairy folk, and returned years later thinking only a night has passed. In the time of Queen Victoria they were bowdlerised into the pretty things people think of today. Whatever that child is seeing is most likely dangerous."

\par Gwen lived in a house in Woodlands Crescent, presumably named because the houses on the inside of the curve backed onto a patch of woodland. Gwen's was one of them. "That's her house here!" Elanor exclaimed as Mifunwi drove slowly past.
\par "I know, but I want to see
 the area with trees." Mifunwi turned left at the next side street, which proved to be a cul de sac. She parked the car at the end, where a laneway led into the woods. Thirty yards brought them to an open area with a playing field and buildings and houses
 on the far side.
\par "It's hardly the wild woods." Mifunwi commented. She led Elanor back, and onto a small track that led into the wooded area.
\par "Bike tracks and paw prints." Elanor commented. "It looks as if children frequent this area."
\par "I imagine some of them would find this a wonderful place to play. You could picture ruined castles, monsters, Robin Hood and his band somewhere in here. What have you noticed?"
\par Elanor was looking into the trees, trying to find the sources of movement she could see only out of
 the corners of her eyes. "I don't think it's birds, squirrels maybe? But when I focus on it there's nothing." She stood completely still, letting her mind take in the surroundings, gazing without focusing. "There's lights too. Can you see them? They're o
nly at the corners of my eyes."
\par Mifunwi smiled mysteriously. "Oh yes, we are being watched, and our watchers are not friendly. I've seen what I need to see, lets walk around to Gwen's house."
\par It was not quite two o'clock, but Gwen served them tea and freshl
y baked scones. She chatted away incessantly. "Grant, that's my partner, is happy you've come to talk to Mary, he thinks you will talk some sense into her. I wish you could talk some sense into him, she's only ten, surely she can talk to fairies if she wa
nts to. She came home for lunch but she's gone back to school now."
\par "The school's not far then?" Mifunwi asked.
\par "Oh no, she goes through our back gate, there's a path through the woods to the playing field, and the school's on the other side. She says the fairies talk to her along the path, and sometimes they chase away strangers that follow her."
\par "Yes, they chase away people they don't like, often adults." Mifunwi commented.
\par "What sort of strangers?" Elanor asked. "I mean, school children or adults?"
\par "Oh, I'm not sure. School children most likely, what would adults be doing following a child through the woods?" Her eyes widened. "Oh! It could be some sort of pervert. Maybe you could take a look later to see if there's any strange men hanging around - 
we should report that to the police. Then it's good if the fairies chase them away. But Mary said some of the boys used to throw stones but they stopped after the fairies chased them away."
\par "I expect the fairies would give them a good scare." Mifunwi managed to get in.
\par "Mary told me this morning she didn't like that you would be coming around, she said the fairies told her you would try to prevent her from seeing them."
\par "Mary has nothing to fear from us, but I want to find out what she does with them, and if possible meet them myself." Mifunwi replied. "What time is your hair appointment?"
\par "Yes, I should get ready soon." At that point the phone rang, and Gwen went to answer it. They heard her side of the conversation - especially the part where she said "She left here over half an hour ago, she should be there!"
\par Mifunwi walked over to Gwen and took the phone from her; Elanor helped herself to another scone with butter and jam.
\par "Hello? ... I'm Mary's aunt. She's not at school? ... All right, we'll go and look for her... We'll call you back... Yes, give me the number... Thank you, goodbye."
\par Gwen was visibly shaking. Mifunwi turned to her "Gwen, do you have any clothing Mary wore yesterday that you haven't washed?" Gwen shook her head mutely. "A hair brush with some of her hair? Good, go and fetch that now."
\par Mifunwi turned to Elanor. "I rather think I should go alone, I will find the girl quicker. Will you stay and look after Gwen?"
\par "I think she will want to go with you. But I will stay with her." I'm big mama, I get to look after everyone. But my husband is dead these past ten years, who looks after me?
\par "Than you." Mifunwi replied. Then, as if reading Elanor's mind, she added "The holy mother will look after you."
\par At this point Gwen came hurrying downstairs, hairbrush in hand. Mifunwi took the brush and held it briefly. "I can feel her, she is unharmed. I will go and fetch her home."
\par Gwen visibly brightened at the news. "I'm coming with you!"
\par "Not in that miniskirt." Mifunwi countered. "Gwen, phone your hairdresser and tell her you might be a bit late. Then run upstairs and change. Elanor and I will clear the table."
\par Elanor was happier about the prospect of finding the girl unharmed. But when the two women had taken the dishes, scones and so on into the kitchen Mifun
wi said "Elanor, please trust me on this. I do not want Gwen with me where I am going. That means you must stay with her. If she wants to go into the woods, go with her and look after her. And..." She unclasped a pendant from around her neck, that Elanor 
had not noticed until she did so. "Wear this." Mifunwi clasped it about Elanor's neck. "It will protect you."
\par "What is it?" The pendant appeared to be a silver disk with carved onyx set in it, shaped like a raven, and holding a spear in its claws.
\par "That is an ancient emblem of the Raven Queen. Those in the woods will recognise it."
\par At that moment they heard Gwen clattering down the stairs. "Tell her I went outside." Mifunwi put a finger to her lips in a shush gesture, and faded out. Elanor's eyes widened and
 she shut her mouth with a snap. Mifunwi had always claimed magical powers. Now what should she say to Gwen?
\par "I'm ready!" Gwen came running into the kitchen. "Oh where's Mifunwi?"
\par "She said she didn't want to wait."
\par "Oh! That's not very fair! Mary is my daughter."
\par "I know." Elanor replied. "I wouldn't want to stay behind if she were mine. We'll catch her up. You finish putting these away, I need to use your bathroom."
\par They were out of the house within minutes, through the back gate and at the start of the w
oodlands. Elanor could sense things moving, watching. Gwen on the other hand was determined to find her daughter. Elanor stopped Gwen. "They're angry. Wait." Then she addressed the trees. "We are searching for this woman's daughter, a little girl who is l
ost. Grant us safe passage, and help us to find her." There was no response.
\par "Do we need to say that?"
\par "It might help. Let's go."
\par There was a reasonably straight path the led to the playing field, along with several smaller side tracks. There was no sign of
 Mary anywhere in the open area. Elanor cast about and spotted the impression of a small shoe that could have been Mary's. The track led through the woods parallel to the playing area. Gwen agreed and they took the path, little more than a goat track.

\par There were strange rustling noises from the surroundings, half seen movement in the trees, bizarre bird calls, and somewhere ahead a deep buzzing like a swarm of angry wasps, only larger. "This is spooky." Gwen commented. "Do you think Mary goes this way 
often?"
\par Elanor had been thinking about this. "I think they're friendlier to children." It was definitely spooky, intentionally so Elanor thought.
\par After a way they seemed to be approaching the source of the thrumming, and Elanor thought she could discern hum
an groans. The source was off their track, so once the two of them agreed Elanor headed into the trees, pushing her way through the undergrowth. After a few yards they came to a small clearing invisible from the track.
\par Face down on the ground was a middle 
aged human male in a dark grey suit, his trousers and underpants around his ankles, and his arms shielding his head. Shadowy figures swarmed about him, appearing to beat him. Try as she might, Elanor could not make out any details of the figures. Gwen loo
ked like a rabbit in a headlight.
\par Elanor drew a breath "What's going on here?" she bellowed.
\par The swarming figures resolved themselves into five humanoids scarcely five feet tall, slender, clad in green and brown. Their faces and heads were elongated - point
y chins, ears, noses, heads and teeth. They all had short cropped blond hair, upward slanting eyes and claws on their fingers. They were probably the reality behind mythical elves, but could easily be mistaken for demons. They were armed with swords, and 
had the two women surrounded. "Oh!" was all Gwen exclaimed.
\par "You should not be here." the middle one hissed. His voice was breathy, the vowels odd. Gwen clutched Elanor's arm.
\par "No?" Elanor's voice was a mixture of scolding mother and school mistress. "We are looking for a lost child. You appear to be skulking around in the woods. What is going on here?"
\par The middle one considered this. "What we do is none of your business." It said coldly. Some of the vowels rose and fell in tone. "The child you seek is not here. Leave us."
\par "Maybe we should ..." Gwen began.
\par Elanor waved her to silence. She drew herself up to her full height and glared down at the band. In her bare feet Elanor was six feet three inches, but now she was wearing boots with two inch platform soles
 and four inch heels. Her long dark hair was knotted on top of her head, and the rest fell in a cascade to her shoulders. A pair of ornate chopsticks were stuck in the bun, and she was carrying a few extra pounds. She didn't just tower over them, she loom
ed. She glared at them, then leaned forward, thrusting the medallion into the face of the speaker. "Do you recognise this?"
\par He stepped back, and there was a hiss of inbreath from one of the others. He reached forward slowly, touched the medallion, studied i
t for several moments. Then he trilled like a bird. One of the others trilled a reply. "We recognise it. From where did you get it?" He was speaking with careful politeness now.
\par Elanor permitted herself a small smile. "The owner gave it to me. She said to show it to those who dwell here because they would respect it. Do you respect it?"
\par There was a chirp from one of the group, and the speaker translated. "We respect it."
\par "Good. Let's start again. What is going on here?" The why of their respect could wait until later.
\par "We are punishing him."
\par "Why?"
\par The other paused. "He tried to rape the child you seek. We stopped him."
\par Gwen surprised everyone. "You bastard!" she turned and kicked the fallen man.
\par Elanor grabbed her. "Cool it Gwen." She turned back to the group. "Where is the child now? Is she all right?"
\par "Oh, she is well, and happy and safe."
\par "Then you will lead us to her."
\par There was a trilled and chirped discussion amongst the group, like a number of birds quarrelling. Gwen said "She's my child! You take me to her!"
\par Elanor intervened. "Quiet all of you! When I was given this medallion, I was told to find the child. Will you take me to her, or must I tell the lady you refused?"
\par The speaker of the group spoke softly, politely. "We do not refuse. There is a small problem. We do not know where the child is. We can take you to someone who might know."
\par "Then that's a start. Hopefully he won't claim he doesn't know, and continue to lead us in circles."
\par "No, we would not do that to you. That medallion is genuine, we must respect any emissary of the Raven Queen. You will come with me, the other humans will stay here."
\par "No." Elanor was firm. "Gwen comes with me - she is the child's mother, and is under my protection, by explicit instruction of the Raven Queen." Mifunwi g
ave that instruction with the medallion, it's not too much stretch. She turned to the man on the ground, who was looking around fearfully. Elanor prodded him with the toe of her boot. "You! Get up, pull your pants up. I'm placing you under my protection. 
You will come with us too."
\par The group looked at her with consternation. One of them trilled, and that seemed to be a decision. "Very well. Follow us." They set off down the track.
\par "Elanor, where did you get that medallion?" Gwen asked.
\par "I'll tell you the story when we get home, Gwen. Now," She directed her voice to her escort. "how should I refer to you? You call us humans, you obviously don't include yourselves."
\par The spokesman chirped briefly. "You cannot say that, but you have your own words for us - Faery, Veela, Alfar, Elves among others. Our people were here long before the humans arrived. We are the original children of Danu."
\par "I know about them!" Gwen interjected. "Danu was a goddess, and her children were the original bronze age inhabitants of Britain."
\par "Not quite. The children of Danu were the heroes who taught humans the arts of civilisation."
\par Elanor continued questioning them. "Why do you dislike us so much?"
\par It took several more questions to draw out the answer, but paraphrased
 it was "There are thousands of reasons. Once we lived in the forests and woodlands, you lived on the coastal fringes and river banks and nearby caves. You would hunt our forests, but you returned to your caves and your huts. Then you began clearing the f
o
rest, our home, and you dug up, and you burned, and you destroyed and you polluted the air and the water and the land, and you killed us with your poisons and your traps and your iron weapons and your diseases and your filth. We have magic, and we lived i
n harmony, but you destroyed us, and you have no magic. Some humans respect us, most nowadays do not even know we exist, and those who do fear us." 
\par The band of Faery didn't really want to talk with the humans. And the human male didn't want to talk either.
 He gave his name as Alfred Smith, and denied doing anything wrong. "I was walking around the park when I saw the girl at the edge of the woods and she was talking to someone but I couldn't see anyone. When I went closer she ran into the woods. I walked i
n and those things attacked me."
\par "I think we will have to deal with that later. I will ask the girl, of course." Alfred went quiet at that, and ignored them as best he could.
\par Elanor tried again with the Faery. "Do you have names we can use, instead of sayin
g 'Hey you!'? I'm Elanor, this is Gwen." She reflected for a moment on the English custom of referring to people by their surnames - at work most people referred to her as Johnson and not Elanor.

\par }\pard \ql \fi143\li0\ri0\sa120\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\f27\fs20 The track seemed to be very long, far longer than could be accounted for by the length of the woodland. The woods seemed 
to becoming wilder, greener, and even the quality of light through the trees seemed different, more yellow.
\par "Do you live in the woodlands where we met you?"
\par "No, we have our own realm."
\par "Then what were you doing in the woodlands?"
\par "We are guards. Some of the paths lead to our realm, and we prevent humans from wandering in."
\par "Why are you interested in human children? If you don't like humans then your interest in our children could seem sinister."
\par "Human children have not yet been corrupted like adults. We can take them to our realm and show them wonders, and they become friendly to our people."
\par "How far are we going? This isn't the woods we started in." I know they are doing something, and I'm not sure I like it. There's legends about people vanishing into the faery realms. This has to be their realm.
\par "You are observant." Speaker to Humans said. "Our destination is not far now."
\par The group walked for about another fifteen minutes. Their path broadened into a dirt road wide enough for a modern day car. Looking 
about, Elanor saw there were luscious multi hued flowers in the woods, while the trees were taller and older. They came to a clearing perhaps as big as a house block, with a huge oak tree in the middle. Elanor could hear the tinkling of many small bells, 
the chirping of many different birds - or perhaps the Faery conversing, and many small colored lights that darted hither and yon.
\par Alfred looked about gloomily. Gwen turned to Elanor "Elanor, this isn't the wood behind my house. Where are we?"
\par "This is one of the faery realms. Don't ask me how we got here, ask them." My children play a game called dungeons and dragons, this is like we've walked into one of those games, she thought. I hope there's a way out.
\par "Oh, I suppose that's all right then. Do you think Mary is here?". How bizarre, Elanor thought.
\par "I'll ask them. Speaker to Humans, where is this woman's child? Is she near?"
\par "We await the queen's representative, who can answer your questions. Our task is done, we brought you here, but do not count on being allowed to go home." he replied nastily.
\par "So you don't respect this medallion?"
\par "We do, that is why you are here. But we cannot give permission for you to leave, that is for the Queen to decide." With that the band of Faery withdrew to the side of the clearing. 
\par Elanor led Gwen and Alfred to the central oak. "It looks as if we have to wait. Gwen, maybe we should have stayed home."
\par "No, I have to find Mary. It looks beautiful here, I can understand why Mary wants to visit with the fairies."
\par Elanor thought, is it just me that thinks there's something wrong here? "Alfred, why are you shivering?"
\par Alfred looked sullenly at her. "You heard what he said, we're stuck here. I know the legends, you go into faery land you don't come back, or you come back years later, and every one you knew is old or dead. I didn't want to be here in the first place."

\par "Yes, but we're alive, unharmed, and still free. We're expecting an official to arrive with Mary, and then we'll go home. I expect you'll say we shouldn't eat or drink while we're here."
\par "No, that's dangerous. I've head that's one way to become trapped here for ever."
\par Elanor sighed. Gloomy Alfred and happy Gwen, that made her the realist in the middle. She would continue to trust they would be allowed to leave until circumstances proved her right or wrong.
\par They waited about twenty minutes before Elanor heard the sounds of music and jingling in the dista
nce. Another ten minutes and a troop of people on horse back rode slowly in, accompanied by gaily clad Faery playing musical instruments or singing and dancing. Some of the musicians possessed curved horns on their heads reminiscent of rams'. The horses w
e
re white except for one, with silver, gold and precious stones on their harnesses. Most of the riders were clad in white painted medieval armor, but two were not. One was Mifunwi, astride a coal black horse, clad in black leather with silver buckles, her 
r
aven dark hair bound with a circlet of silver. In her right hand she carried a short spear with a long leaf shaped silver blade and three black feathers just behind the blade. Beside her rode the official, or possibly queen herself, clad in white silks an
d a complicated silver harness studded with precious stones, and a gem encrusted silver tiara in her long golden hair. 
\par "Where's Mary?" Gwen asked.
\par "On the horse behind Mifunwi." Her head was peering from behind Mifunwi. Gwen waved at her daughter.
\par The Faery whom Elanor thought of as the queen surveyed their small group. "My lady, are all these yours?"
\par Mifunwi smiled "I believe so. Elanor, who is the man?"
\par "Alfred." Elanor explained the circumstances, adding "So I placed him under your protection until you could deal with him." Mifunwi was obviously respected here, the official deferred to her as 'my lady' while she accorded her no such honorific.
\par "Thank you Elanor. The witnesses are all here, let us hear what they say."
\par Speaker to Humans came forward and exp
lained that Alfred had taken to hanging around the woods and following school girls into them. The Faery guards usually chased him away. But this time he had chased Mary and caught her before they were aware of either of them. They had then imprisoned him
,
 beaten him, and were debating whether to kill him when Elanor arrived and took him into her protection. One of their number had already been tasked with conveying Mary to the queen, they were happy to await the queen's instructions and therefore had conv
eyed all three adult humans here for her consideration.
\par "You have done well, the queen is happy to consider their fate. Bring Mary before the queen."
\par At this command one of the knights alighted from his horse, bowed, and walked to Mifunwi's horse. "Your Hig
hness, with your permission." Mifunwi nodded. The knight lifted Mary from the horse and held her hand as they walked to stand in front of the Faery Queen. "Your Royal Highness, the human girl Mary."
\par The queen looked down haughtily. "Mary, tell the Faery queen what happened." So, thought Elanor, this wasn't the royal 'we' but the royal third person.
\par Mary's tale was similar to that of Speaker to Humans. She walked through the woods every day on her way to and from school, and often stopped to talk with the fa
iries. The man had begun following her over a month ago, but never into the woods because the fairies chased him away. He wasn't the only man, and sometimes she would stay in the woods until they went away, or a group of older children went past that she 
c
ould walk with. Lunch time today she had walked through the woods but hadn't seen any fairies. She walked out of the woods and almost collided with the man. She ran into the woods, he followed, and caught up with her, catching her arm. She screamed and th
e fairies came and rescued her. Then one of the fairies walked with her into fairyland.
\par "You bastard! I'll kill you myself!" Gwen flung herself at Alfred, Elanor grabbed her just in time.
\par "Go and stand by the horse of the Raven Queen." The queen ordered. "Bring the human male before the Faery queen."
\par Another of the knights dismounted, but Mifunwi ordered "Elanor, you bring Alfred please." 
\par Alfred had started shivering again. Elanor released Gwen, satisfied she wasn't about to attack Alfred again. "Alfred, ca
n you walk? You won't wet yourself?" He shuddered, nodded. Together they walked toward the Faery queen. Gwen, realising she was the only person beneath the oak, darted after them. When they passed through the ring of horsemen, Gwen went to stand with her 
daughter, while Elanor stood near Alfred. It wasn't that she wanted to, but it seemed appropriate.
\par Alfred stammered and stuttered his way through an explanation. He loved children, he meant them no harm. He just wanted to talk with them, play with them. But everyone seemed to misunderstand him. He hadn't meant to frighten the girl. 
\par Mifunwi leaned forward from her horse. "And what sort of games did you have in mind playing with the girl? Is it girls only, or do you like young boys too?" Alfred didn't seem to
 know how to answer that. Mifunwi sat up again. "I can see your thoughts. Your ideas of play involve games adults might play in private. Tell me why." Alfred stammered something unintelligible, shook his head. Mifunwi stared at him, then nodded. "I see. Y
our uncle did that to you when you were six, and continued until you were almost ten. You never healed, and now you perpetuate the wrong." Alfred's mouth worked, then his eyes filled with tears and he sobbed.
\par Elanor looked at him, feeling a mixture of revulsion and pity. It was dawning on her he was sick, damaged, but not quite the evil monster she had thought. Briefly she wondered what she would be like now if she had been molested as a child. But what to do 
with him?
\par Mifunwi turned to the queen. "The Faery queen has heard the testimonies. How says the Faery queen?"
\par The Faery queen appeared to be thinking for several moments. Then she spoke formally. "This is an affair between humans, and occurred in the human 
realm. The Faery foresters behaved correctly, and no Faery has been harmed. The Faery queen begs the Raven Queen to take the humans back to the human realm and deal with them as she sees fit."
\par "The Raven Queen thanks the Faery queen for her wisdom. The humans will be dealt with in accordance with the laws and practices of the human realm. And now she begs leave of the Faery queen."
\par "The Faery queen grants such leave." She bowed from her horse. "May the winds be always beneath your wings."
\par "May the earth be 
always beneath your feet." Mifunwi inclined her head to the queen, who wheeled her horse; her troop copied her in unison, and they rode back the way they came. The other Faery folk seemed to blend into the forest, and vanished. The humans appeared to be a
lone within the clearing. Mifunwi dismounted, holding the rains of her horse.
\par There was a raucous cawing, and a raven flew through the clearing, alighted near Mifunwi, and shimmered into a human clad in black leather. Mifunwi handed the rains of her horse t
o the human, who bowed and mounted the horse. They wheeled and trotted across the clearing, vanishing into a rainbow smear before reaching the far side. "Let's go home." Mifunwi commented. "We'll save any discussion until then."
\par Together they set off back the way Elanor and Gwen had come. At some point Mifunwi's form shimmered, and she was back to the lady who had visited Gwen. Her spear had vanished. "How did you do that?" Elanor asked. 
\par "Magic is easier in the faery realms." Mifunwi held her fingers to he
r lips and continued walking. When they came to the main path through the woods, Mifunwi produced a business card and gave it to Alfred. "You will go straight home, and you will stay home tonight. Tomorrow at noon, you will come to that address. I will se
e what I can do to heal you. Don't even think about not showing up! I am the Raven Queen."
\par Alfred nodded, watery eyed. "Thank you, I will be there. I hope you can do something." He walked off toward the playing fields, hand in pockets, stooping, looking at the ground.
\par "Gwen, you should call your hairdresser, see if he can still fit you in. I can mind Mary while you are away."
\par "Yes, thanks. Erm, what happened back there? Did we really go to fairyland? Are you really some sort of queen?" Gwen responded. "I don
't even know where to start!" Elanor thought that there was a lot she want to know too, but her questions could wait until Gwen left.
\par They were approaching the back gate. Mifunwi said quite simply "I told you I have powers. I have been to the faery realm b
efore, they call me the Raven Queen. Mary is still young enough to get into the faery realm, I never forgot how." Gwen opened the gate and they walked into the back yard.
\par "Oh, I was going to cook a roast for dinner, I have to put that on! There won't be time to go to the hairdresser."
\par Mifunwi laughed. "Do you think I can't cook? Just show me what you want to cook, and tell me when you want it finished."
\par Gwen came back from the phone. "She's had a cancellation, she can see me right away! I have to fly! Oh thank you for everything Mifunwi, I'll talk to you later."
\par Mifunwi headed to the phone. "Someone should phone the school. Then we'll get that roast on."
\par Mary and Elanor helped peel vegetables and put everything in the oven. "Mummy was supposed to put everyth
ing in the roasting dish in the fridge, and I was going to put it in the oven when I got home." Her eyes were shining. "Are you really a fairy queen? We saw the fairy queen!"
\par Mifunwi smiled. "It's a long story, I won't tell it all now. But in the faery rea
lm I am known as the Raven Queen, and I can do magic. I can do a little here, but it works better in the faery realm. Your mother said you could talk with the fairies, and that is why I said I would visit you. Not all fairies are good. They are like human
s, some are bad, some are sick, some are stupid. You should not go into the faery realm by yourself, only with company of fairies, or me."
\par "You're not going to stop me then? My step father said you would stop me from seeing the fairies again."
\par "No, but you 
should be careful not to tell things about fairies to your step father. Sometimes you need to keep a few secrets, because he doesn't understand, and what he doesn't understand he fears. Promise me you won't tell your father about today, and I promise I'll
 help you to see the fairies as you grow up. Otherwise, in a few years, the fairies will ignore you just like they ignore most humans."
\par "Oh, I don't want that to happen. I want you to help me see the fairies."
\par Elanor asked Mifunwi "What did you tell the school?"
\par "Only that Mary was chased by a man and hid in the woods. I also told the headmistress that several men have been hanging around the playing field, she will tell the police."
\par "Gwen is taking it all very calmly."
\par "I think she's always wanted to see fa
iries and in some ways this is like a dream come true." Then she laughed. "Mary, to your mother this was like a dream, it is fading. By the time she returns from the hairdresser she will not remember much. Just tell her you hid in the woods from the man, 
and that the fairies helped you."
\par They chatted for a while longer, and then said their good-byes. "Don't go into the woods again today, the fairies won't be there. The fairy queen was not happy that her foresters spend so much time with you, and you don't want to upset the fairy queen!"

\par At the front door, Mifunwi and Elanor both hugged Mary. As Mary unlocked the door, there was a raucous cawing, and two ravens flapped overhead, one alighting on the fence, another in a nearby tree. Mifunwi smiled. "The ravens
 will see that no harm comes to you."
\par Back in the car, Elanor commented "If I hadn't seen things with my own eyes, I would not have believed it. I want to know more. How did we get into the faery realm? Why did everything happen today when we came to visit? And how did you get to be the Raven
 Queen?"
\par Mifunwi laughed. "Things were due to happen today, which is why I insisted on visiting today. Tomorrow would have been too late, Mary would have been missing for a day. How we got in and out is magic, you'll have to learn that, I can't simply expla
in it. Except, if you think of our realm as a single page in a book, then the faery realm is another page in the same book. In some places the pages touch, and you can walk from one to the other."
\par "And can you really help Alfred? I didn't realise he was molested as a child, it puts things in a different light."
\par Mifunwi sighed. "Too many people go through life damaged, and perpetuating that damage. I can help him heal, but he needs to want to heal. Just like you need to want to move on after your husband's d
eath; ten years later and you are still dealing with it. I can help you heal, and it could damage your health if you don't. But I can't make you do that, it's up to you."
\par "Hmm, you've told me that before. I feel I am healing, getting over it, just slowly. You are staying for dinner, the children want to see Auntie Mifunwi again." Elanor changed the subject, not wanting to talk about Abe's death.
\par "That's what we arranged. Otherwise I might have insisted Gwen invite me for dinner. But that can wait. Gwen won't mention what happened today to her partner, and Mary will be seeing a lot less of the faery folk."
\par "Are faery folk common? I mean, this is a suburban area, I'd think they would be driven away."
\par "They prefer the wild areas, that is true. But you could meet with them in any wooded area if they care to visit, and show themselves."
\par "Mary got into the faery realm, and more than once. Is that good or bad? Does that sort of thing happen elsewhere? Or often? Didn't Speaker say they guarded the path into their realm?"
\par Mifunwi chuckled. "Good or bad depends on the intentions of the folk she meets. In regards to whether it happens to other people, here's something to think about. You have heard of UFOs, and alien abductions. I believe that some, perhaps many of these
 abductions, are the faery folk. They have been abducting people for millennia; UFOs are only recent. With regards to Mary, the Faery were planning to keep Mary with them for years. She went willingly, but then would have found she could not get out. Even
tually they would let her go, and she would come back a teenage girl to a world where her parents were very old or even dead. I spoke with the queen, they will not do that to Mary now. In their realm I am the Raven Queen, and they dare not cross me."

\par Elanor tried to read between the lines. "They kidnapped you, didn't they? How long ago?"
\par Mifunwi was suddenly serious. Elanor could have sworn that for one brief instant her eyes looked positively ancient. "Elanor, I am a lot older than I look. I stayed there fo
r many years, I came back to a very different world, and even that was a long time ago. I have been back to the faery realm many times, I do not seem to age. But I think we have had enough impossible things for one day. Your parents will be wondering wher
e you have got to, and so will your children. We should be home soon."
\par Elanor\rquote s thoughts were buzzing. Today she had seen proof that magic did exist, along with faery folk. Well, Elanor thought to herself, to be able to do magic, as Mifunwi had demonstrated, and not to grow old, as she had claimed, might be something
 to aim for. Especially if she would be encountering denizens of the other world again.
