\viewkind4\uc1\pard\ltrpar\nowidctlpar\hyphpar0\fi283\cf1\f0\fs22 Elanor regretted drinking quite so much alcohol combined with several cups of coffee. Now her thoughts were racing, her head was spinning and it was difficult to get to sleep. It wasn\rquote t that she was drunk, just overtired and wide awake. Her conversation with Luke about her husband\rquote s death had sent her on an emotional roller coaster.\par
Maybe if she had gone to the anti war protest all those years ago she might have been able to prevent the cops arresting him, beating him unconscious and leaving him to die in the cells. She was heavily pregnant at the time, and Luke didn\rquote t think she could have helped, and thought it more likely she would have been arrested and beaten as well.\par
During her conversation she had realised that she still carried a lot of unresolved anger about what happened. She was angry with the cops of course - to them Abe was just some uppity nigger causing trouble who deserved what he got. They had never been identified let alone punished - they had removed anything from their uniforms that could have identified them, and all Abe's friends could say was they were white cops.\par
She was angry with Abe for going and doing something to get himself arrested. If he hadn\rquote t been arrested he\rquote d still be alive today, would have seen his three children grow up, seen his grand-daughter born. She had not even said a proper good-bye to him, she\rquote d been changing the baby when he\rquote d kissed her on the cheek and left. The next time she saw him was to identify his badly beaten body in the morgue.\par
And she was angry with herself that she hadn\rquote t done something to stop him - kept him home, gone with him, something, anything.\par
The tears were flowing now, but this time she gave herself over to body wrenching sobs. She had managed to control herself in front of Luke, but during her discussion with him she had realised she had never really dealt with Abe\rquote s death. Her excuse was she was always too busy with the children, and the day to day busyness of life.\par
Eventually she felt all cried out, hollow and empty like an old bottle. Her nose was blocked, her eyes puffy. She went into the bathroom to wash her face, ended by having a very long hot shower. Finally she collapsed into bed, tired and emotionally exhausted.\par
She kept thinking of Abe, and her discussion with Luke. Their faces spun about her along with flashes of cities. As soon as she focused on anything it flowed and changed into something else. Nothing was fixed. She lost track of time, and realised that some features did seem to be fixed, while other ones flowed and then became fixed.\par
She had no idea of where she was or how she got here, and only vague memories of the Elanor who had gone to bed. The sky was pale, almost white. She was in the garden near a house made of bricks so dark they might have been coal. Trees and shrubs had very dark trunks and branches and dark green leaves. Here and there were bright red flowers she did not recognise - large trumpet shaped things with pale yellow throats. Everything was crystal clear - she could see every blade of grass, every leaf and twig, every insect no matter how tiny, every minor blemish in the brickwork. \par
Looking around she seemed to be in a farming village because there was some distance to nearby houses and she could see fields with crops behind each house. Off to her right there were three large columns about three meters high, one coal black, the other two gun metal grey. They were floating about a hand span above the grass.\par
\ldblquote Elanor! El!\rdblquote\par
She turned to see a figure approaching from the corner of the house. She recognised him instantly, he looked much the same as when they married. \ldblquote Abe!\rdblquote  They both hurried to each other, hugged and kissed. \ldblquote I\rquote ve missed you Abe.\rdblquote  There was something wrong with this picture, but she could not put her finger on it. \ldblquote You\rquote re looking well.\rdblquote\par
\ldblquote So are you El, you\rquote re still as beautiful as when we married.\rdblquote  He led her around the side of the house and into a sunlit English cottage garden. There were birds chirping and a profusion of flowers everywhere.\par
\ldblquote Where have you been Abe? How come you never wrote?\rdblquote\par
Abe looked at her with sadness. \ldblquote They told me this would happen. I\rquote m dead El, been dead for years. I couldn\rquote t write, there\rquote s no postal service.\rdblquote\par
Elanor knew she should be surprised. Instead she remarked \ldblquote You're looking well for someone that\rquote s dead. Does this mean I\rquote m dead? Where are we?\rdblquote\par
Abe sighed \ldblquote You\rquote re not dead, least ways not yet. This is one of the places we come when we die. You\rquote re just visiting.\rdblquote\par
\ldblquote Oh. Then how did I get here? I don't remember being here before.\rdblquote\par
\ldblquote I don\rquote t think you have been. Do you remember Luke?\rdblquote  Elanor nodded, surprised. \ldblquote He said he\rquote d bring you, I don\rquote t think you can come here when you\rquote re alive unless someone brings you.\rdblquote\par
\ldblquote What do you do here? Are there other people here? Can you show me around?\rdblquote\par
Abe looked over at the three columns that had followed them into the garden. \ldblquote Does she have time?\rdblquote\par
\ldblquote There is time for a brief tour.\rdblquote  a voice replied, a light masculine voice speaking with an upper class English accent.\par
\ldblquote Who was that? What was that?\rdblquote  Elanor was genuinely puzzled.\par
Abe nodded at the three columns. \ldblquote One of them. We see them all over the place, they can answer questions. People I know call them guides.\rdblquote  Elanor was curious, but at this point Abe got to his feet and led her through the garden to the street. They turned left.\par
The street seemed to run on forever, with no cross streets. It was sprinkled with houses spaced apart, and behind each house was a garden, farm area with crops, or orchards, vineyards and so on. From time to time she could hear roosters crow, and the occasional house had a few hens in the front yard. The houses ranged in style from super modern mansions to quaint little wooden houses that looked like they had stepped from the Hansel and Gretel fable. From time to time villagers nodded or waved to Abe. What ever else this was, the place was multicultural. Elanor spotted Europeans, Africans, Indians and Asians as they walked. Abe seemed to be living the life of a villager. He had his vegetable patch, his vineyard, and some chickens and a few pigs. This was a side of him she wasn\rquote t aware of.\par
Abe pointed into the distance. \ldblquote See that hill? That\rquote s where the university is, the schools and the town centre. Let\rquote s go there.\rdblquote\par
Elanor was still staring into the distance trying to make out what he was pointing at when he grabbed her arm and pulled. Next moment the scenery blurred around her. There was no sense of movement, but they were standing on some grass looking at stone buildings. Elanor was not good at architecture, but she tagged the buildings as something you\rquote d see in an old European city.\par
\ldblquote That\rquote s the university, there are classes in everything. Anything you can think of!\rdblquote  Abe enthused. \ldblquote We don\rquote t have time to visit there, let\rquote s go this way.\rdblquote  He led across the grass to a paved street lined with shops and cafes. They sat down at a table, and Abe ordered coffee and cake for both of them from a waiter who materialised beside their table. He returned a moment later with their order.\par
\ldblquote That was fast!\rdblquote  Elanor remarked. Abe nodded.\par
They talked for a while about what she had been doing, and a little about his flower garden, vineyard and vegetable patch. \ldblquote That doesn\rquote t seem like you.\rdblquote  Elanor remarked. \ldblquote You never liked gardening.\rdblquote\par
\ldblquote Things are different here, there\rquote s time to smell the roses, time to study things. I\rquote m preparing for my next life, most people study things to improve themselves for their next life.\rdblquote\par
\ldblquote Really? When will that happen?\rdblquote  \par
\ldblquote Oh soon, I hope. I\rquote ve made arrangements to be born as our grandson.\rdblquote\par
\ldblquote Aren\rquote t you going to wait for me?\rdblquote\par
Abe shook his head. \ldblquote No, it\rquote s time for me to move on. But El, you have to let me go. You\rquote re holding me here, you never moved on, you never grieved properly. I can\rquote t move on until you grieve and let me go. If you don\rquote t I can\rquote t be reborn, and I\rquote ll have to wait until you die. And then I\rquote ll be stuck here helping you, and I\rquote ll miss my chance. I\rquote m bored. El, I\rquote m dead, please let me go. I\rquote ll be back as your grandson then.\rdblquote\par
Elanor looked at him, uncertain what to say, but some part of her was aware he was telling the truth. She focused on something negative \ldblquote What do you mean if you wait until I die you\rquote ll be stuck here helping me?\rdblquote\par
\ldblquote Oh. Erm, when you die, someone comes and collects your soul. It\rquote s usually a family member or friend, but not always. My grandparents were still alive when I died; I helped them when they passed on. Luke collected me, and then we went to a hospital, or something like that, where there are people who look after you and heal you after the trauma of death, and what ever else was bad in your life. Then you come some place like this where you can study and prepare for your next life. My chance is to be born as my own grandson. If I miss that, I don\rquote t know how long I\rquote ll have to wait, or I\rquote ll be born among strangers. And I can\rquote t leave here because you\rquote re holding onto me. So if you won\rquote t let go, I have to wait until you die, and I might as well help you get through the transition.\rdblquote\par
\ldblquote Where are your grandparents?\rdblquote  Elanor realised she was stalling for time, thinking over what he said. \par
\ldblquote Oh, they\rquote re around the village somewhere. They\rquote ll be reborn in a few years, and they\rquote d like to come back amongst family members. If I\rquote m born as our grandson they could become my children, or some sort of relative.\rdblquote\par
Elanor looked at Abe. \ldblquote How do I let you go?\rdblquote  As she asked the question she realised she already knew the answer.\par
\ldblquote What people normally do. They grieve for a time, and they get over it and get on with their lives. That\rquote s what the funeral is for \endash  to give the living a chance to say farewell. I know I was young; it was unexpected, but there is it. Death happens to all of us, and we all get reborn. If you love me El, you can do this for me. You can say good bye and release me to be reborn.\rdblquote\par
Elanor\rquote s eyes were stinging. She leaned forward and hugged Abe, kissed him. Her tears were making his face wet. \ldblquote I love you Abe, but deep inside I know this is what I have to do. I know I\rquote ll see you again, but we won\rquote t be husband and wife.\rdblquote  She sat back, blew her nose. \ldblquote Good bye Abe. And may God be with you.\rdblquote\par
\ldblquote Thanks El. When I\rquote m reborn, you\rquote ll know it\rquote s me. Good bye. I\rquote ll see you soon.\rdblquote\par
There was a sudden feeling of falling, and Elanor woke with a start. She lay there feeling both happy and sad, and trying to remember as much as she could. Abe was right, she had to let him go; she didn\rquote t have the heart to tell him she\rquote d be dead in a few months herself from cancer. Or would she? She felt emotionally drained, but relieved. She knew she had done the right thing. But what had he said? Luke came to collect him when he died? She would have to ask Luke about that.\par
