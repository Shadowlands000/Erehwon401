Isn't that wonderful?" The speaker, Gwen, was a plumpish woman in her late thirties with bottle blonded hair. She looked around the group, basking in murmured comments of approval.\par
How bizarre, Elanor thought. But then, English people did a number of strange things. Elanor was keenly aware that she was the only African in a group of nine women and four men. The group was supposed to be studying wicca, the old religion, and learning a healthy respect for anything that lurked at the bottom of their gardens. Africans would be a lot more wary, but then this group seemed to be mostly bored housewives and a couple of weird guys.\par
"Really?" That was Mifunwi, the group's mentor, and Elanor's personal friend, the real reason Elanor joined the group. She was also the only other person here who wasn't English. Mifunwi was a petite woman with milk pale skin, long hair dark as a raven's wing, and startlingly green eyes. She looked about thirty, but she had looked that age ten years ago when she and Elanor first met.\par
"Have you seen them yourself?" Mifunwi continued. "Do you know what they look like? Or what your daughter talks with them about?"\par
"Er, no." Gwen was deflated. "She tells me she plays with them. She says they look like in the pictures - you know, pretty little things with wings, and glowing with light."\par
"Ah, I see. Things are often not what they seem. I think I should meet these beings for myself. When would be convenient? It should be a time when your daughter is home, and when she normally would play with them."\par
"Oh, that would be after school, or the weekend. But my partner's home then, and he doesn't like Mary talking about fairies. He doesn't approve."\par
"Mmm, then we will be round friday afternoon. Best do this before the weekend."\par
"Er, I have a hair appointment then."\par
"Will Mary be home?" Mifunwi wasn't dissuaded. "We'll drop around before you leave." That was settled. Mifunwi was difficult to say no to.\par
As they were leaving, Mifunwi turned to Elanor. "Elanor, I'd like you to come with me on friday. I feel something is going to happen that afternoon, and you will be needed."\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi143\sa120\qc***\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi143\sa120 Mifunwi drove a silver Mercedes with black leather interior. "Did you know anything of this?" she asked Elanor as they set off.\par
"No, I don't know Gwen all that well. Her Mary is about the same age as my Leah, but Leah goes to a different school."\par
"Mmm. You and I know that these things probably aren't harmless. They have a reason for befriending a child."\par
"I didn't grow up here, I'm not sure what fairies are. I've read about them though." She agreed Mifunwi's assessment.\par
"What you've read is likely to be wrong. The legends tell of beings with magical powers. They were a separate people from humans, long lived, short of stature, with elongated heads. But that covers many folk, from elves, pixies, goblins and so on. The fairies have a reputation for stealing children, and they can make put a glamour on themselves to make them appealing to humans. The legends also tell of adults who've gone to dance with the fairy folk, and returned years later thinking only a night has passed. In the time of Queen Victoria they were bowdlerised into the pretty things people think of today. Whatever that child is seeing is most likely dangerous."\par
Gwen lived in a house in Woodlands Crescent, presumably named because the houses on the inside of the curve backed onto a patch of woodland. Gwen's was one of them. "That's her house here!" Elanor exclaimed as Mifunwi drove slowly past.\par
"I know, but I want to see the area with trees." Mifunwi turned left at the next side street, which proved to be a cul de sac. She parked the car at the end, where a laneway led into the woods. Thirty yards brought them to an open area with a playing field and buildings and houses on the far side.\par
"It's hardly the wild woods." Mifunwi commented. She led Elanor back, and onto a small track that led into the wooded area.\par
"Bike tracks and paw prints." Elanor commented. "It looks as if children and dogs frequent this area."\par
"I imagine some of them would find this a wonderful place to play. You could picture ruined castles, monsters, Robin Hood and his band somewhere in here. What have you noticed?"\par
Elanor was looking into the trees, trying to find the sources of movement she could see only out of the corners of her eyes. "I don't think it's birds, squirrels maybe? But when I focus on it there's nothing." She stood completely still, letting her mind take in the surroundings, gazing without focusing. "There's lights too. Can you see them? They're only at the corners of my eyes."\par
Mifunwi smiled mysteriously. "Oh yes, we are being watched, and our watchers are not friendly. I've seen what I need to see, let's walk around to Gwen's house."\par
It was not quite two o'clock, but Gwen served them tea and freshly baked scones. She chatted away incessantly. "Grant, that's my partner, is happy you've come to talk to Mary, he thinks you will talk some sense into her. I wish you could talk some sense into him, she's only ten, surely she can talk to fairies if she wants to. She came home for lunch but she's gone back to school now."\par
"The school's not far then?" Mifunwi asked.\par
"Oh no, she goes through our back gate, there's a path through the woods to the playing field, and the school's on the other side. She says the fairies talk to her along the path, and sometimes they chase away strangers that follow her."\par
"Yes, they chase away people they don't like, often adults." Mifunwi commented.\par
"What sort of strangers?" Elanor asked. "I mean, school children or adults?"\par
"Oh, I'm not sure. School children most likely, what would adults be doing following a child through the woods?" Her eyes widened. "Oh! It could be some sort of pervert. Maybe you could take a look later to see if there's any strange men hanging around - we should report that to the police. Then it's good if the fairies chase them away. But Mary said some of the boys used to throw stones but they stopped after the fairies chased them away."\par
"I expect the fairies would give them a good scare." Mifunwi managed to get in.\par
"Mary told me this morning she didn't like that you would be coming around, she said the fairies told her you would try to prevent her from seeing them."\par
"Mary has nothing to fear from us, but I want to find out what she does with them, and if possible meet them myself." Mifunwi replied. "What time is your hair appointment?"\par
"Yes, I should get ready soon." At that point the phone rang, and Gwen went to answer it. They heard her side of the conversation - especially the part where she said "She left here over half an hour ago, she should be there!"\par
Mifunwi walked over to Gwen and took the phone from her; Elanor helped herself to another scone with butter and jam. She was putting on weight, but one more shouldn't hurt.\par
"Hello? ... I'm Mary's aunt. She's not at school? ... All right, we'll go and look for her... We'll call you back... Yes, give me the number... Thank you, goodbye."\par
Gwen was visibly shaking. Mifunwi turned to her "Gwen, do you have any clothing Mary wore yesterday that you haven't washed?" Gwen shook her head mutely. "A hair brush with some of her hair? Good, go and fetch that now."\par
Mifunwi turned to Elanor. "I rather think I should go alone, I will find the girl quicker. Will you stay and look after Gwen?"\par
"I think she will want to go with you. But I will stay with her." I'm Big Mama, I get to look after everyone. But my husband is dead these past twelve years, who looks after me?\par
"Than you." Mifunwi replied. Then, as if reading Elanor's mind, she added "The great mother will look after you."\par
At this point Gwen came hurrying downstairs, hairbrush in hand. Mifunwi took the brush and held it briefly. "I can feel her, she is unharmed. I will go and fetch her home."\par
Gwen visibly brightened at the news. "I'm coming with you!"\par
"Not in that miniskirt." Mifunwi countered. "Gwen, phone your hairdresser and tell her you might be a bit late. Then run upstairs and change. Elanor and I will clear the table."\par
Elanor was happier about the prospect of finding the girl unharmed. But when the two women had taken the dishes, scones and so on into the kitchen Mifunwi said "Elanor, please trust me on this. I do not want Gwen with me where I am going. That means you must stay with her. If she wants to go into the woods, go with her and look after her. And..." She unclasped a pendant from around her neck, that Elanor had not noticed until she did so. "Wear this." Mifunwi clasped it about Elanor's neck. "It will protect you."\par
"What is it?" The pendant appeared to be a silver disk with carved onyx set in it, shaped like a raven, and holding a spear in its claws.\par
"That is an ancient emblem of the Raven Queen. Those in the woods will recognise it. If necessary, tell them it is a gift from the raven queen."\par
At that moment they heard Gwen clattering down the stairs. "Tell her I went outside." Mifunwi put a finger to her lips in a shush gesture, and faded out. Elanor's eyes widened and she shut her mouth with a snap. Mifunwi had always claimed magical powers. Something to ask her about later. Now, what should she say to Gwen?\par
"I'm ready!" Gwen came running into the kitchen. "Oh, where's Mifunwi?"\par
"She said she didn't want to wait."\par
"Oh! That's not very fair! Mary is my daughter."\par
"I know." Elanor replied. "I wouldn't want to stay behind if she were mine. We'll catch her up. You finish putting these away, I need to use your bathroom."\par
Within minutes they were out of the house, through the back gate and at the start of the woodlands. Elanor could sense things moving, watching. Gwen on the other hand was determined to find her daughter. Elanor stopped Gwen. "They're angry. Wait." Then she addressed the trees. "We are searching for this woman's daughter, a little girl who is lost. Grant us safe passage, and help us to find her." There was no response.\par
"Do we need to say that?"\par
"It might help. Let's go." You always told the spirits what you planned so there would be no misunderstanding.\par
There was a reasonably straight path the led to the playing field, along with several smaller side tracks. There was no sign of Mary anywhere in the open area. Elanor cast about and spotted the impression of a small shoe that could have been Mary's. The track led through the woods parallel to the playing area, running behind the houses. Gwen agreed and they took the path, little more than a goat track.\par
There were strange rustling noises from the surroundings, half seen movement in the trees, bizarre bird calls, and somewhere ahead a deep buzzing like a swarm of angry wasps, only larger. "This is spooky." Gwen commented. "Do you think Mary goes this way often?"\par
Elanor had been thinking about this. "I think they're friendlier to children." It was definitely spooky, intentionally so Elanor thought.\par
"Can you hear bells?" Gwen asked, looking about.\par
"No." Elanor shook her head. The angry thrumming was becoming louder though. "Where are the bells?"\par
"This way." The same direction as the thrumming then. Elanor pursed her lips into a grim line. Gwen turned, heading off their track.\par
"Are you sure it's wise to go that way?" Elanor asked. She had a bad feeling about the noise.\par
"Yes! Look! Fairies!"\par
"Where?" Elanor looked around wildly.\par
"Fluttering around that tree! Aren't they beautiful?"\par
Elanor looked where Gwen was pointing. "I can see coloured lights floating. What do the fairies look like?"\par
"Like little dolls with butterfly wings and dragon fly wings." Gwen was walking towards the tree, eyes wide in wonder.\par
Elanor was wondering why she saw only coloured lights when she realised there was movement behind the tree. She pushed through the undergrowth. Lying on his back on the ground was a middle aged human male in a dark grey suit, his mouth open in a silent scream. Swarming over him were several shadowy, mis-shapen figures. One thrust its arm down the man's throat to the elbow, and then withdrew it, trailing red rose petals. The man convulsed, then flopped bonelessly, dead or unconscious.\par
"Hey! Get off him!" Elanor barged into the group, scattering them. The man's face was fixed in a rictus of a scream, eyes wide open, his mouth filled with rose petals. She'd have to clear that out before giving him mouth to mouth, Elanor thought, wondering why they'd done that. She knelt with her ear to his chest - there was no heartbeat.\par
She was thinking about chest compression to try restarting the man's heart when clawed fingers grasped her shoulder. "He's dead, human, there's nothing you can do." someone hissed. His voice was breathy, the vowels odd.\par
Elanor swung around, knocking the arm away. "You killed him! Why? How?"\par
They were five humanoids scarcely five feet tall, slender, clad in green and brown. Their faces and heads were elongated - pointy chins, ears, noses, heads and teeth. They all had short cropped blond hair, upward slanting eyes and claws on their fingers. They were probably the reality behind mythical elves, but could easily be mistaken for demons. They were armed with swords, and had the two women surrounded. \par
"Who are you talking to?" Gwen asked dreamily, still watching the coloured lights.\par
"She can't see you." Elanor remarked thoughtfully, getting to her feet, the better to deal with any threat. They were deadly, that was obvious, but they hadn't directly threatened her or Gwen yet.\par
"You should not be here." the middle faery hissed.\par
"No?" Elanor's voice was a mixture of scolding mother and school mistress. "We are looking for a lost child. You appear to be skulking around in the woods. What is going on here? Why did you kill him?"\par
Elanor stood in the ready position, feet as wide apart as her shoulders, joints loose, fists half clenched near her waist, eyes gazing levelly at the five faeries. She still remembered the karate she'd studied as a teenager, could still do the moves, still practiced when she found time.\par
She should be scared, but for some reason she wasn't. They'd been disconcerted that she could see them, they weren't sure what else she might be capable of. They seemed to regard her as dangerous, and that was something to work with. She had a thousand questions, but most could wait; she couldn't afford the luxury of appearing weak.\par
\par
\par
\par
\par
 "What we do is none of your business." the faery said coldly. Some of the vowels rose and fell in tone. "The child you seek is not here. Leave us, mortal, lest you end up like him."\par
"How can she see us through our glamour?" another asked.\par
"Maybe we should put her eyes out, and her tongue..." a third began.\par
"Elanor, who are you talking to? There's no one near you." Gwen interjected.\par
Elanor waved her to silence. "Don't any of you threaten me!" She drew herself up to her full height and glared down at the band. In her bare feet Elanor was six feet three inches, but now she was wearing boots with two inch platform soles and four inch heels. Her long dark hair was knotted on top of her head, and the rest fell in a cascade to her shoulders. A pair of ornate chopsticks were stuck in the bun, and she was carrying a few extra pounds. She didn't just tower over them, she loomed. She glared at them, then leaned forward, thrusting the medallion into the face of the speaker. "Do you recognise this?"\par
He stepped back, and there was a hiss of inbreath from one of the others. He reached forward slowly, touched the medallion, studied it for several moments. Then he trilled like a bird. One of the others trilled a reply. "We recognise it, it is genuine. From whom did you get it?" He was speaking with careful politeness now.\par
Elanor permitted herself a small smile. "The owner gave it to me. She said to show it to those who dwell here because they would respect it. Do you respect it?"\par
There was a chirp from one of the group, and the speaker translated. "We respect it."\par
"Good. Let's start again. I saw you put your arm down his throat and kill him. Why?" The why of their respect could wait until later.\par
"We punished him."\par
"Why?"\par
At that moment Gwen let out a scream. "Elanor, what are those ..."\par
"Gwen, be quiet. They won't harm us. Let me talk to them." Why should Gwen be able to see the faeries now?\par
"But what are they?"\par
The middle figure answered slowly. "We removed the glamour from her eyes. We are the old ones. We are your nightmares, mortal! You trespass in our lands. Do as your companion says and you won't be harmed."\par
\par
\par
Another added. "He tried to harm the child you seek. We stopped him."\par
Gwen surprised everyone. "You bastard!" she turned and kicked the dead man.\par
Elanor grabbed her. "Cool it Gwen. He's dead, don't antagonise the faeries." \par
"What?!" Gwen exclaimed.\par
"These are the reality behind your pretty fairies. You heard them say they killed him because he attacked Mary. Please stop interrupting."\par
She turned back to the group. "Where is the child now? Is she all right?"\par
"Oh, she is well, and happy and safe."\par
"Then you will lead us to her."\par
There was a trilled and chirped discussion amongst the group, like a number of birds quarrelling. Gwen said "She's my child! You take me to her!"\par
Elanor intervened. "Quiet all of you! When I was given this medallion, I was told to find the child. Will you take me to her, or must I tell the lady you refused?"\par
The speaker of the group spoke softly, politely, though he looked sullen. "We do not refuse. There is a small problem. We do not know where the child is. We can take you to someone who might know."\par
"Then that's a start. Hopefully he won't claim he doesn't know, and continue to lead us in circles."\par
"No, we would not do that to you. That medallion is genuine, we must respect any emissary of the Raven Queen. You will come with me, the other human will stay here."\par
"No." Elanor was firm. "Gwen comes with me - she is the child's mother, and is under my protection, by explicit instruction of the Raven Queen."\par
 Mifunwi gave that instruction with the medallion, it's not too much stretch. The group looked at her with consternation. One of them trilled, and that seemed to be a decision. "Very well. Follow us." They set off down the track.\par
"Elanor, where did you get that medallion?" Gwen asked.\par
"I'll tell you the story when we get home, Gwen. Now," She directed her voice to her escort. "how should I refer to you? You call us humans, you obviously don't include yourselves."\par
The spokesman chirped briefly. "You cannot say that, but you have your own words for us - Faery, Veela, Alfar, Elves among others. Our people were here long before the humans arrived. We are the original children of Danu."\par
"I know about them!" Gwen interjected. "Danu was a goddess, and her children were the original bronze age inhabitants of Britain."\par
"Not quite. The children of Danu were the heroes who taught humans the arts of civilisation."\par
Elanor continued questioning them. "Why do you dislike us so much?"\par
It took several more questions to draw out the answer, but paraphrased it was "There are thousands of reasons. Once we lived in the forests and woodlands, you lived on the coastal fringes and river banks and nearby caves. You would hunt our forests, but you returned to your caves and your huts. Then you began clearing the forest, our home, and you dug up, and you burned, and you destroyed and you polluted the air and the water and the land, and you killed us with your poisons and your traps and your iron weapons and your diseases and your filth. We have magic, and we lived in harmony, but you destroyed us, you who have no magic. Some humans respect us, most nowadays do not even know we exist, and those who do fear us." \par
"Don't think you will be allowed to return home." one of them chortled. "And when we finally let you go, you'll find hundreds of years have passed, and all your family and friends will be dead."\par
Elanor bantered back. "Well, my husband is dead these past twelve years, my parents can look after my children. I might enjoy visiting your lands, and I've often wondered what the world would be like a hundred years from now."\par
"Elanor, I want to take Mary and go home!" Gwen wailed.\par
"Oh Gwen, he's just teasing you, he wants you to bite."\par
"Humans who enter uninvited are killed. We might put both your heads on poles as a warning to others."\par
"Ohhh!" Gwen wailed.\par
"Stop it Gwen, they won't do that, we're guests, under protection of the Raven Queen." Then her eyes flashed. "You kill me, my angry ghost will haunt you the rest of your short miserable days! And they will be miserable, I promise you!"\par
The five faeries all made warding gestures, hissing. "Let it not happen." So they believed in such things.\par
"Then no more trying to frighten us. You treat us with respect, and we will treat you with respect. But if you mess with Big Mama, you'll be sorry."\par
\par
\par
 \par
\par
\par
Elanor tried again to make conversation. "Do you have names we can use, instead of saying 'Hey you!'? I'm Elanor, this is Gwen." She reflected for a moment on the English custom of referring to people by their surnames - at work most people referred to her as Johnson and not Elanor.\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi142\sa120"Our names are not given lightly. I am one who can speak with humans, you may call me 'Speaker to Humans'. The others do not speak English well." But they probably all understand it, Elanor thought. \par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi143\sa120 The track seemed to be very long, far longer than could be accounted for by the length of the woodland. The woods seemed to becoming wilder, greener, and even the quality of light through the trees seemed different, more yellow.\par
"Do you live in the woodlands where we met you?"\par
"No, we have our own realm."\par
"Then what were you doing in the woodlands?"\par
"We are guards. Some of the paths lead to our realm, and we prevent humans from wandering in."\par
"Why are you interested in human children? If you don't like humans then your interest in our children could seem sinister."\par
"Human children have not yet been corrupted like adults. We can take them to our realm and show them wonders, and they become friendly to our people."\par
"How far are we going? This isn't the woods we started in." I know they are doing something, Elanor thought. There's legends about people vanishing into the faery realms.\par
"You are observant." Speaker to Humans said. "Our destination is not far now."\par
The group walked for about another fifteen minutes. Their path broadened into a dirt road wide enough for a modern day car. Looking about, Elanor saw there were luscious multi hued flowers in the woods, while the trees were taller and older. They came to a clearing perhaps as big as a house block, with a huge oak tree in the middle. Elanor could hear the tinkling of many small bells, the chirping of many different birds - or perhaps the Faery conversing, and many small colored lights that darted hither and yon.\par
Gwen turned to Elanor "Elanor, this isn't the wood behind my house. Where are we?"\par
"This is one of the faery realms. Don't ask me how we got here, ask them." My children play a game called dungeons and dragons, this is like we've walked into one of those games, she thought. I hope there's a way out.\par
"Oh, I suppose that's all right then. Do you think Mary is here?" How bizarre, Elanor thought.\par
"I'll ask them. Speaker to Humans, where is this woman's child? Is she near?"\par
"We await the queen's representative, who can answer your questions. Our task is done, we brought you here, but do not count on being allowed to go home." he replied nastily.\par
"So you don't respect this medallion?"\par
"We do, that is why we conducted you safely here. But we cannot give permission for you to leave, that is for the Queen to decide. You will stay here." \par
Another group of seven armed faeries greeted the first group. They trilled to each other, then the first band of Faery withdrew to the side of the clearing. \par
Elanor led Gwen to the central oak. "It looks as if we have to wait. Gwen, maybe we should have stayed home."\par
"No, I have to find Mary. It looks beautiful here, I can understand why Mary wants to visit with the fairies."\par
One of the new faeries screamed "Humans! You will stand in the sun!"\par
"No." Elanor replied coolly. "The shade is cooler."\par
The faery brandished his sword in her face, screaming "Do not be insolent, human! We will cut your tongue out! Now obey!"\par
Gwen shielded her eyes, whimpering "He's covered in flames."\par
"That's an illusion, Gwen." Elanor turned to face the angry faery, squaring her shoulders and puffing out her chest. "I am the emissiary of the Raven Queen." She replied haughtily. "You will show me respect."\par
"Respect? Humans are pigs wallowing in muck! I'll show you respect, like this!" He struck at her with the sword hilt, a hammer blow that should have smashed her face.\par
Elanor reacted by instinct. She swayed back while the edge of her left forearm swept out and up, blocking the blow by striking the inner edge of his forearm, sending the sword flying from his grasp. Her right fist followed through, smashing him in the face. He turned his head at the last moment, and her fist struck his cheek with a solid thump.  He went down as if poleaxed.\par
Elanor glared at the others. "Anyone else want to try that? No? Then get him out of here, he needs a healer."\par
Speaker to Humans came over at a run, chirping furiously. Elanor picked up the fallen faery's sword. Then she checked the faery's vital signs - he was breathing; then she unbuckled the scabbard from his waist.\par
"What are you doing?" Speaker to humans asked.\par
"A sword should always be kept in its scabbard unless you are about to use it. I don't plan on using it, unless you force me to."\par
"They will not attack unless they are ordered to, or you attack them."\par
The faery she'd hit was bleeding from the nose. "Get him to a healer, he's injured."\par
"No, he must stay until his superior has seen him. A healer has been sent for." Elanor raised mental eyebrows at this. How had they summoned a healer?\par
Elanor and Speaker to humans looked at one another in silence for a few moments. Then Speaker to humans added "He thought you couldn't see him or touch him."\par
"Why? I can see through your glamour, I touched you earlier."\par
"He didn't believe what I told him. Now they all believe, and will respect you."\par
 "Thank you for explaining." Elanor inspected the sword. The blade was made from some reddish metal, leaf shaped, sharpened along both edges, and pointed. The hilt was of creamy horn, bound with what looked like gold wire, with simple quillions to protect the hand from anything sliding down the blade, and a weighted pomel to counter-balance the blade. The hilt was small in her hand, the sword light. The whole thing showed signs of use.\par
"What metal is the blade made from?" Elanor sighted along the blade, spotting a slight kink. There were silver runes engraved in the blade, but some of the silver had worn and fallen away. "The blade's seen hard usage. How old do you think it is?" With that she placed the sword into its scabbard.\par
"The metal is sun steel, you humans use moon steel. The colors are different, but I am not a sword smith." He chirped to the group of faery soldiers the fallen faery belonged to. There was a quick conversation before he translated "They think the sword is hundreds of years old, he was very proud of it. He will be sad to lose it. They want to know what ransom you want for him."\par
"Ransom?" Elanor was thinking quickly. "Could you please explain?"\par
The faery looked thoughtful. "You defeated him in combat, he was armed, you were not. That means you have great honour and respect, while he has shame. All his weapons and armour belong to you, and he is your prisoner. It is our custom to demand payment from the kin of a prisoner. Once it was also human custom."\par
Elanor knew enough to know this could go well or ill by her choice of actions. One thing she couldn't do was refuse to keep him as her prisoner.\par
"Very well, I shall keep his sword. Have him well treated and healed, I am not in a position here to look after a prisoner. I will have to talk with my mentor about a suitable ransom."\par
The faery soldiers all nodded, proving they all understood English, and seemed to relax. Gwen was shivering, and Elanor put her arm about the woman.\par
"I'm scared! And I want to take Mary and go home!"\par
"We'll be going soon; no one is going to hurt us now." Gwen burst into tears, while Elanor tried to soothe her like a small child.\par
The healer arrived, another faery in colorful medieval style robes. He stared at Elanor while the others explained things to him, then snorted, shook his head and inspected the patient. He performed some magic, alarming Elanor when she spied green light coming from his hands and playing over the patient. \par
Gwen could not see the light. "We should have stayed at home." she declared bitterly.\par
Eventually the light died. "He should rest today and tonight; he will be fully recovered tomorrow. I will call in tomorrow to see him, and collect my fee." He turned to look at Elanor again.\par
"You punched him once? Are you injured? Let me look at your arms and hands."\par
Elanor held  them out for his inspection, aware of the chipped nails and callouses. "I'm sorry, they're not very feminine. I can break bricks with my fists. And I hit the inside of his forearm with the outside of mine, the strong bone against the weak." She had broken bricks, although not for years. But her training was now a set of instinctive reactions, faster than conscious thought. It had undoubtedly saved her from serious injury.\par
"A warrior's hands. You are uninjured. No one else is injured? I will be away then."\par
Speaker to humans looked at her almost with admiration. "Many of us would not attempt to disarm a swordsman with our bare hands. They are all saying you are a mighty warrior." \par
"I studied martial arts for many years. Unarmed combat and some weapons." The faeries began asking her questions, seemingly genuinely interesteded.\par
They were still conversing when Elanor heard the sounds of music and jingling in the distance. The guards and soldiers formed into two groups, with two of the soldiers rousing their sleeping comrade. He moved sullenly to stand with Elanor. Another ten minutes and a troop of faery on horse back rode slowly in, accompanied by gaily clad faery playing musical instruments or singing and dancing. Some of the musicians possessed curved horns on their heads reminiscent of rams'. The horses were white except for one, with silver, gold and precious stones on their harnesses. Most of the riders were clad in white painted medieval armor, but two were not. One was Mifunwi, clad in black leather with silver buckles, her raven dark hair bound with a circlet of silver, astride a coal black horse. In her right hand she carried a short spear with a long leaf shaped silver blade and three black feathers just behind the blade. Beside her rode the important official, clad in white silks and a complicated silver harness studded with precious stones, and a gem encrusted silver tiara in her long golden hair. \par
"Where's Mary?" Gwen asked.\par
"On Mifunwi's horse." Her head was peering from behind Mifunwi. Gwen waved at her daughter.\par
The faery official surveyed their small group. "My lady, are both these yours?" Mifunwi was obviously respected here.\par
Mifunwi smiled "Yes, your majesty, and the dark skinned lady bears my medalion." So the official was the queen herself.\par
"It is fitting that the emissary of the Raven Queen should be dark hued. The witnesses are here, let us hear what they say."\par
Speaker to Humans came forward and explained that a man had been hanging around the woods and following human children. The faery guards usually chased him away. But this time they had heard Mary's screams and discovered him trying to harm her. They had beaten him and then killed him as Elanor arrived. One of their number had already been sent with Mary to the queen. \par
When Elanor demonstrated that she could see them despite the glamour they wore, they realised she was no ordinary human. Then she showed them the medalion, and explained that she had been instructed to find the child, they decided that both women should be conveyed here.\par
"You have done well, the Faery Queen is happy to consider their fate. Bring Mary before the queen."\par
At this command one of the knights alighted from his horse, bowed, and walked to Mifunwi's horse. "Your Highness, with your permission." Mifunwi nodded. The knight lifted Mary from the horse and held her hand as they walked to stand in front of the Faery Queen. "Your Royal Highness, the human girl Mary."\par
The queen looked down haughtily. "Mary, tell the Faery Queen what happened." So, thought Elanor, this wasn't the royal 'we' but the royal third person.\par
Mary's tale was similar to that of Speaker to Humans. She walked through the woods every day on her way to and from school, and often stopped to talk with the fairies. They were always pretty little beings with wings; they would tell her things and sometimes play with her. They even promised to take her to Faery land to stay with them. The man had begun following her over a month ago, but never into the woods because the fairies chased him away. Lunch time today she had walked through the woods but hadn't seen any fairies. She walked out of the woods and almost collided with the man. She ran into the woods, he followed and caught her arm. She screamed and the fairies came and rescued her. Then one of the fairies walked with her into fairyland.\par
"Go and stand by the horse of the Raven Queen." The queen ordered. Mary walked to stand by Mifunwi's horse, Elanor noted. \par
"My lady, with your permission I would question your emissary."\par
"Certainly, your majesty. Elanor, please stand forth and tell the Faery Queen what occured after I gave you my medalion."\par
Elanor walked forward with some trepidation. She stopped near the queen; she had no idea how to curtsy and instead gave a Japanese style bow. She sketched briefly their journey into the woods, discovery of the faery folk and the human they killed, and how after seeing the medallion, the faery guards had brought them here.\par
"Did they offer to convey you here?"\par
"No, your majesty, after they agreed that the medalion was genuine, I told them I had been ordered to find the girl, and requested that they bring me to Mary. They said the best they could do was to bring me here, and await your majesty's instruction."\par
"And the girl's mother?"\par
"She is under my protection, your majesty, by order of the Raven Queen. I insisted she come with us."\par
"And a good servant always obeys. You may go and stand by the horse of the Raven Queen. I will question the girl's mother. Come here human."\par
Elanor felt like a school girl brought before the headmistress. Gwen looked startled, then darted forward to stand before the faery queen. She managed an awkward curtsy.\par
"You are Mary's mother?"\par
"Er... Yes, your majesty." Her voice was shaking, and one leg was trembling.\par
"Tell us in your own words what happened."\par
Gwen started with the phone call, worked her way through the encounter with the fairies in the forest. She could remember only the pretty little fairies, not the proud grotesque faeries, and even now could not see through the faery queen's glamour.\par
 Finally the faery queen ordered "That is all. Go and stand beside your daughter."\par
Mifunwi spoke. "Your majesty, there is one more witness to call, the spirit of the dead human."\par
Elanor was expecting Mifunwi to call the soldier she had punched, and by his look of relief, he too had been expecting to be called. How were they going to question the dead man?\par
The faery queen replied "Yes. Is there anything you need, my lady?" She sounded eager to question the dead man.\par
"Thank you, no, your majesty; everything I need is to hand." Mifunwi turned to look at Elanor. "Elanor, Gwen, Mary, please do not be frightened by what will happen."\par
Mifunwi sat tall in her saddle. "First, I need to lay a fire of fragrant wood." With a rainbow shimmer, a pile of wood appeared on the ground some six meters in front of them. Elanor sighed, resolving to ask Mifunwi later. Gwen made a girlish squawk of surprise.\par
"Now we need fire, from the fire spirits." Orange yellow flames flickered, becoming a proper fire within a minute.\par
"We also need smoke for the spirit to manifest." The fire obligingly began to smoke.\par
"I sent my ravens in search of the man's spirit. Now they return." A flock of ravens flew from over the treetops and circled the group. \par
"Alfred Fordham, come down into the smoke where others can see you." The flock dropped, flying through the smoke, then settled in the branches of the oak tree. Elanor was surprised to see the dead man's form appear in the smoke.\par
"Alfred, can you speak?"\par
He was peering around, shock painted across his face. "They... they... killed me!" His voice sounded like wind in the trees.\par
"Yes Alfred, do you know why? Can you tell us what you were doing in the hour before you died?"\par
Any moment now, Elanor thought, I'll wake up safe in my own bed.\par
\par
\par
 Alfred stammered and stuttered his way through an explanation. He loved children, he meant them no harm. He just wanted to talk with them, play with them. But everyone seemed to misunderstand him. He hadn't meant to frighten the girl. \par
Mifunwi leaned forward from her horse. "And what sort of games did you have in mind playing with the girl? Is it girls only, or do you like young boys too?" Alfred didn't seem to know how to answer that. Mifunwi sat up again. "I can see your thoughts, Alfred. Your ideas of play involve games adults might play in private. Tell me why." Alfred stammered something unintelligible, shook his head. Mifunwi stared at him, then nodded. "I see. Your uncle did that to you when you were six, and continued until you were almost ten. You never healed, and instead you perpetuated the wrong." Alfred's mouth worked, then his eyes filled with tears and he sobbed.\par
\par
\par
Elanor looked at his soul flickering in the smoke, feeling a mixture of revulsion and pity. It was dawning on her he was sick, damaged, but not quite the evil monster she had thought. Briefly she wondered what she would be like now if she had been molested as a child.\par
Mifunwi turned to the queen. "Your majesty, do you have any questions for this man's spirit?"\par
"No, my lady; the Faery Queen has heard all she needs to hear."\par
"Thank you. Alfred! You are dead, it is time to move on. You can try to be a better person next life. My ravens will escort you to a suitable place in the afterlife."\par
The ravens left their oak tree and circled the fire. Alfred's soul drifted up out of the smoke and vanished from Elanor's sight. The circling ravens formed into a flock and flew off into the clouds.\par
"Fire spirits, thank you." Mifunwi announced. "You may leave." The fire went out, leaving nothing but a pile of ash behind. "Ash, return to earth." The ash vanished without a trace, leaving the grass untouched.\par
\par
"The Faery queen has heard the testimonies. How says the Faery queen?" \par
The Faery Queen appeared to be thinking for several moments. Then she spoke formally. "This is an affair between humans, and occurred in the human realm. The foresters behaved correctly, and no Faery has been harmed. The Faery Queen begs the Raven Queen to take the humans back to the human realm."\par
"The Raven Queen thanks the Faery Queen for her wisdom. And now she begs leave of the Faery queen."\par
"The Faery Queen grants such leave." She bowed from her horse. "May the winds be always beneath your wings."\par
"May the earth be always beneath your feet." Mifunwi inclined her head to the queen, who wheeled her horse; her troop copied her in unison, and they rode back the way they came. Most of the other Faery folk seemed to blend into the forest, and vanished. The humans appeared to be alone within the clearing, except for the faery still standing under the oak tree, and his companions behind the tree. Mifunwi dismounted, holding the rains of her horse.\par
There was a raucous cawing, and a raven flew through the clearing, alighted near Mifunwi, and shimmered into a human clad in black leather. Mifunwi handed the rains of her horse to the human, who bowed and mounted the horse. They wheeled and trotted across the clearing, vanishing into a rainbow smear before reaching the far side. \par
"Before we leave, Elanor, why are you holding a faery sword?"\par
Elanor explained, including what Speaker to humans had told her about weapons, armor and ransom.\par
Mifunwi rounded on the faery. "You attacked my emissary? Why?"\par
The faery hung his head. "I behaved stupidly, your majesty. I did not believe she was your emissary, I did not believe the medallion was genuine. I thought she was a human sorcerer playing tricks."\par
"Every queen will issue a token to her emissary, and any faery can test that a token is genuine." Mifunwi reprimanded. "You behaved badly." She turned away. "Elanor, do you wish to keep the sword?"\par
"Yes. Erm, if you think it's all right."\par
"Yes, it is yours by right. Now, what are we to do with him. I don't suppose you want to take him back to your home and look after him until his kin pay ransom."\par
"I'd prefer not to." It's just a small home, with three children. And how would he behave? He'd scare the children and the neighbours.\par
Mifunwi smiled. "No, and I don't imagine he would want to spend weeks or even years in the human realm as your prisoner."\par
Mifunwi turned back to the crestfallen faery. "It is inconvenient for us to take you with us to the human realms. You will stay here, and return to your duties. You are still technically a prisoner though, you should discuss with your kin what they think is a fair ransom for you. I will return in three weeks to discuss their offer. Do you have any questions?"\par
"No, your majesty, thank you."\par
Mifunwi nodded, turning away. "Let's go home. We'll save any discussion until then."\par
Together they set off back the way Elanor and Gwen had come. At some point Mifunwi's form shimmered, and she was back to the white clad lady who had visited Gwen. Her spear had vanished. "How did you do that?" Elanor asked. \par
"Magic is easier in the faery realms." There was a rainbow shimmer before them, they stepped through it and found themselves on the main path through the woods, near to Gwen's house.\par
"Gwen, you should call your hairdresser, see if she can still fit you in. I can mind Mary while you are away. I also need to call the school, and the police"\par
"Yes, thanks. Erm, what happened back there? Did we really go to fairyland? Are you really some sort of queen?" Gwen responded. "I have so many questions I don't even know where to start!" \par
Elanor thought that there was a lot she wanted to know too, but her questions could wait until Gwen left.\par
They were approaching the back gate. Mifunwi said quite simply "I told you I have powers. I have been to the faery realm before, they call me the Raven Queen. Mary is still young enough to get into the faery realm, I never forgot how. You will find your trip fades like a dream." \par
Gwen opened the gate and they walked into the back yard. "Oh, I was going to cook a roast for dinner, I have to put that on! There won't be time to go to the hairdresser."\par
Mifunwi laughed. "Do you think I can't cook? Just show me what you want to cook, and tell me when you want it finished."\par
Gwen came back from the phone. "She's had a cancellation, she can see me if I leave right away! I have to fly! Oh thank you for everything Mifunwi, I'll talk to you later."\par
Mifunwi headed to the phone. "I'll phone the school and then the police. Then we'll get that roast on."\par
Mary and Elanor helped peel potatoes and prepare vegetables and put everything in the oven. "Mummy was supposed to put everything in the roasting dish in the fridge, and I was going to put it in the oven when I got home." Her eyes were shining. "Are you really a fairy queen? We saw the fairy queen!"\par
Mifunwi smiled. "It's a long story, I won't tell it all now. But in the faery realm I am known as the Raven Queen, and I can do magic. I can do a little here, but it works better in the faery realm. Your mother said you could talk with the fairies; that is why I said I would visit you. Not all fairies are good. They are like humans, some are bad, some are sick, some are stupid. You should not go into the faery realm by yourself, only with company of faeries you can trust, or someone like me, whom the faeries respect."\par
"You're not going to stop me then? My step father said you would stop me from seeing the fairies again."\par
"No, but you should be careful not to tell things about fairies or the faery folk to your step father. Sometimes you need to keep a few secrets, because he doesn't understand, and what he doesn't understand he fears. Promise me you won't tell your father about today, and I promise I'll help you to see the fairies as you grow up. Otherwise, in a few years, the fairies will ignore you just like they ignore most humans."\par
"Oh, I don't want that to happen. I want you to help me see the fairies."\par
"You must be careful though. You now know that pretty fairies are a glamour of lights, while the faery folk are the reality. They can do magic, they are not human, they may not have your interests at heart. Some of them might be like the man you ran away from."\par
"I didn't know that." The girl replied. "They were always friendly, and would play games with me, and chase away bad people."\par
"Yes, but they were only the few who guarded the woods. You did not see the one who attacked Elanor; she knocked him out instead."\par
"With one punch!" Elanor added, laughing. "They don't call me big momma for nothing!"\par
"So I propose that you and I and Elanor should go and visit the faery realm from time to time, but in the meantime you concentrate on the human realm."\par
Elanor asked Mifunwi "What did you tell the school?"\par
"Only that Mary was chased by a man and hid in the woods. I also told the headmistress that several men have been hanging around the playing field and accosting children, she will tell the police. I have omitted to report the body, we don\uc1\u8217\'92t need to become involved."\par
"Gwen is taking it all very calmly."\par
"I think she's always wanted to see fairies and in some ways this is like a dream come true." Then she laughed. "Mary, to your mother this was like a dream, it is fading. By the time she returns from the hairdresser she will not remember much. Just tell her you hid in the woods from the man, and that the fairies helped you."\par
They chatted for a while longer, and then said their good-byes. "Don't go into the woods again today, the fairies won't be there. The fairy queen was not happy that her foresters spend so much time with you, and you don't want to upset the fairy queen!"\par
At the front door, Mifunwi and Elanor both hugged Mary. As Mary unlocked the door, there was a raucous cawing, and two ravens flapped overhead, one alighting on the fence, another in a nearby tree. Mifunwi smiled. "The ravens will see that no harm comes to you."\par
Back in the car, Elanor commented "If I hadn't seen things with my own eyes, I would not have believed it. I want to know more. How did we get into the faery realm? Why did everything happen today when we came to visit? And how did you get to be the Raven Queen? Why can I see through their glamour?"\par
Mifunwi laughed. "Things were due to happen today, which is why I insisted on visiting today. Tomorrow would have been too late, Mary would have been missing for a day. How we got in and out is magic, you'll have to learn that, I can't simply explain it. Except, if you think of our realm as a single page in a book, then the faery realm is another page in the same book. In some places the pages touch, and you can walk from one to the other. Keep the medallion, wearing it allows you to see through their glamour."\par
"I almost feel sorry for Alfred, after finding out his uncle molested him. What a sad, wasted life!"\par
Mifunwi sighed. "Too many people go through life damaged, and perpetuating that damage. He could have healed, but he needed to want to heal. Instead he perpetuated the damage, and in the end the faery folk killed him. Just as you need to want to move on after your husband's death; twelve years later and you are still dealing with it. I can help you heal - it could damage your health if you don't. But I can't make you heal, it's up to you."\par
"Hmm, you've told me that before. I feel I am healing, getting over it, just slowly. You are staying for dinner, the children want to see Auntie Mifunwi again." Elanor changed the subject, not wanting to talk about Abe's death.\par
"That's what we arranged. Otherwise I might have insisted Gwen invite me for dinner. But that can wait. Gwen won't mention what happened today to her partner, and Mary will be seeing a lot less of the faery folk."\par
"Are faery folk common? I mean, this is a suburban area, I'd think they would be driven away."\par
"They prefer the wild areas, that is true. But you could meet with them in any wooded area if they care to visit, and show themselves. The human realm and the faery realm are different, but they touch in many places. The faery put guards on those places to stop things from wandering in."\par
"Mary got into the faery realm, and I think she has done it more than once. Is that good or bad? Does that sort of thing happen elsewhere? Or often?"\par
Mifunwi chuckled. "Good or bad depends on the intentions of the folk she meets. In regards to whether it happens to other people, here's something to think about. The faery folk have been abducting people for millennia. With regards to Mary, the faery were planning to keep Mary with them for years. She went willingly, but then would have found she could not get out. Eventually they would let her go, and she would come back a teenage girl to a world where her parents were very old or even dead. There have been many incidents like this that I know of. I spoke with the queen, they will not do that to Mary now. They dare not cross the Raven Queen."\par
There was a look on Mifunwi's face that said she knew a lot more than she was saying. Elanor tried to read between the lines. "They kidnapped you, didn't they? How long ago?"\par
Mifunwi was suddenly serious. Elanor could have sworn that for one brief instant her eyes looked positively ancient. "Elanor, I am much older than I look. I stayed there for many years, I came back to a very different world, and even that was a long time ago. I have been back to the faery realm many times, I do not seem to age. But I think we have had enough impossible things for one day. Your parents will be wondering where you have got to, and so will your children. We should be home soon."\par
"How long ago? Elizabethan times? The middle ages?"\par
Mifunwi was silent for several minutes. Elanor was about to press her when she started speaking. "Once upon a time, the faery folk were called the Children of Danu, and they moved freely among humans, and humans and faery travelled into each other's realms. I believe the ancient Greeks called them the Danoi. The faery looked much as you have seen them, but they put a glamour on themselves when they were among humans, so they looked like humans. At other times they looked like elves, beautiful, remote, other worldly. Later humans called them the Sidhe..." Mifunwi pronounced it 'she' "Eventually they stopped visiting, hid themselves away, and became the stuff of legends. I am not sure why, maybe the coming of Christians, who regarded them as devils, but I think they began hiding away before the Romans came. Back in the time when Lu... someone" she had stopped from saying a name "showed humans how to make steel. Steel has the power to cut through the protective spells of the faery folk. Don't ask my why.\par
"But still the faery folk continued to interact with humans, though they preferred the wild places; some would come to towns to buy and sell. I could tell you many stories of things that happened over the centuries. Most of the stories that humans tell are about the bad things the faery folk have done to humans, and sometimes of the bad things humans have done to the faery folk. There have been good things done by both sides as well. But from time to time they kidnap human children. They teach them magic, and their customs. Their magic offers the possibility of a long life. Barring accidents, the faery folk can live for milenia."\par
Elanor\u8217\'92s thoughts were buzzing. Today she had seen proof that magic did exist, along with faery folk. Well, Elanor thought to herself, to be able to do magic, as Mifunwi had demonstrated, and not to grow old, as she had claimed, might be something to aim for. Especially if she would be encountering denizens of the other world again.\par
"Elanor, I promised you I would teach you some of the things I know. Now you have seen the faery folk, are you still interested?"\par
"I would have prefered to have been introduced first." Elanor complained. "But I am interested in what you can teach me. Does that include trips to the faery realms, and staying young?"\par
"Yes, and maybe. Staying young depends on how much you learn over what period."\par
"You still haven't answered how old you are."\par
"Ah, Elanor, would you believe me if I told you?" Mifuni chided gently.\par
 "Try me! I think I handled my first visit to the faery realm well enough. We've been friends for years. I'm sure I can handle your real age."\par
Mifunwi chuckled. "We'll see. Let me put it this way. When I first ventured into the faery realm, Stone Henge hadn't been built."\par
"Oh. That's a long time before the Romans, isn't it?"\par
"Yes, Stone Henge is about the same age as the pyramids."\par
"Wow." Elanor said softly.\par
"The further you venture into the faery realm, the slower time runs compared with here, and we don't seem to age while we're there. But that is another day. We have dinner to cook, and children to feed!"\par
