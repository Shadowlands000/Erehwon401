\viewkind4\uc1\pard\li140\sa120\f0\fs20 In another month or so this will be an expensive restaurant in an expensive ski resort. Then it will be packed with well-heeled skiers spending big on fine dining. Now it is host to just a few diners. One side of the restaurant is a glassed in balcony, showing a view of snow covered alps. The setting sun is turning them golden.\par
Near the windows a table was laid with a single place setting. A stylishly dressed woman sat there, finishing a main course. A half empty bottle of Pouilly Fume sat in an ice bucket beside the table. The woman pushed back her plate and drank down the remains of the wineglass.\par
A waiter approached and spoke to her almost before she had finished the glass of wine. He refilled her glass, and spoke with her briefly before collecting her plate and cutlery. She thanked him in French, then picked up her wineglass and walked over to the glassed in balcony. \par
You couldn't see the actual sunset from here, only the effect it had on the mountains. Their golden peaks were slowly turning orange, and shadows were creeping up their flanks. Perhaps it was a metaphor for life. She was in her golden years, but they would fade all too soon, and darkness would creep over her.\par
She shook her head. The first time she had come here her husband had proposed to her. The second time was after his death, and she had been in tears standing here. This time she just sighed. Happiness, life, it was all what you made it.\par
"It is a fine view." a male voice said in French.\par
She started, turning to look at the speaker. He was tall, pale skinned, with dark hair and eyes. His age was hard to determine, but she guessed about forty. Expensively dressed, but with that understated elegance the Europeans seemed to do so well.\par
"Yes, I was admiring the view." she replied in French. "I did not see you approach."\par
"Please accept my apologies. I did not mean to startle you. I thought perhaps you might like to talk a little? If you do not, then I will not disturb you further."\par
"Oh, er..." she was surprised to feel she was blushing. A handsome stranger offering to chat her up. That hadn't happened in years. "Maybe we can talk..." she blurted out in English, then switched back to French. "Sorry, do you speak English?"\par
He smiled, a twinkle in his eyes. "Certainly. At least as well as I speak French. I am called Luke, by the way."\par
"Maybe you can join me at my table?" He nodded his assent, the she led him there. "Luke is not a French name, are you English or American?"\par
"I am neither actually." he seated himself in the empty chair." My real name is unpronounceable, but my friends often call me Luke. Somehow it makes me smile to think I am named for one of the evangelists."\par
The waiter butted in, and they ordered coffees.\par
"I'm Elanor. I am English, but I spent some time here in France. That was where I met my husband."\par
Luke smiled and nodded. "Yes, I see the wedding ring and engagement ring, yet you sit here alone. Are you still married?"\par
Elanor smiled briefly, then looked wistful. "I am widowed. My husband was an American lawyer, he stood up for the rights of African Americans. One day many years ago some police beat him to death. I never remarried."\par
"I am very sorry to hear that. Were his murderers ever caught?"\par
"No." She shook her head. "They all lied to protect each other. I still miss him, but it fades with time. It was almost twenty four years ago now."\par
"It must have been hard for you. Do you have children?"\par
"It wasn't easy. I have three children;  I was pregnant with my third when Abe was murdered. I decided I did not want them to grow up in the American environment, and I brought them to England. I have family there, and there isn't much prejudice."\par
Luke nodded thoughtfully. "Mmm. Europe never had slaves, so the Europeans never developed the prejudice the Americans did. Do you hate those who killed him?"\par
"I did at first, but then I realized they were stupid and misguided, and eventually I forgave them. Hatred would not bring him back, and would only poison my life."\par
"Yes, hatred leads to revenge, and further crimes. It can become an unending cycle. You see it everywhere. You never remarried?"\par
The coffees arrived. They sat silently until the waiter left. "Oh Lord! I was busy bringing up my children, and busy with human rights issues when I had time. And I missed him. If I were going to remarry, he would have to be as good as Abe was, or better."\par
Luke sipped his coffee thoughtfully. "Yes, marriage is about children and inheritance. But unless there is companionship and closeness there really isn't much point. But now your children are grown. Do you think you might consider it in the future?"\par
Elanor chuckled. "I hope you're not propositioning me, Mr. Luke. I am a grandmother now."\par
There was a twinkle in Luke's eye. "I hope you are not saying you consider yourself too old for such things. You are still an attractive woman, and you do not look old enough to have grand children. But I would not proposition you unless I knew you well and knew you would welcome such a proposal."\par
I think he is propositioning me, but he wants to move slowly, Elanor thought to herself. She smiled and replied, "My friends and relatives urged me to remarry. But as you said, marriage is about property and children. I have my children and my property, I would be content to find a companion."\par
Luke chuckled again. "If you have friends and companions, then you will have those to grow old with. There once was an enlightened man who said, "Men, treat every female as your mother, your sister or you daughter. Women, treat every male as your father, your brother, or your son." I believe he was right."\par
Elanor nodded. "That is a good way of putting it. Show respect to everybody and you will avoid a lot of problems. What about you? Are you married?"\par
He smiled ruefully. "Sadly I was too busy trying to set the world to right. I never found time to marry. I do have children, or at least I believe I do, for a man can never be certain that a child a woman says is his is truly his." He grinned at this point. "Now I am not sure if I want to marry. Or for that matter if any woman would have me. I have grown used to doing things my way."\par
Elanor nodded. "Yes, we become set in our ways as we grow older. Tell me more about yourself Luke. Where are you from? What do you do?"\par
"I consider myself a citizen of the world. I am an exile. When I was younger I started a revolution. I stood for freedom and free will against a tyrant, a despot who wanted all to be slaves to his will. For that I was exiled, and branded a traitor, a terrorist, and the epitome of evil. I sought only to set people free."\par
Elanor nodded, took a sip of her wine. "And did you behave badly? Were people harmed by your actions? I don't mean to be judgemental, but I know the human rights movement is not all peace and light."\par
"Regrettably there were deaths and injuries. I am not happy about that, but sometimes it cannot be avoided. I never advocated harming people. I always tried to avoid it where possible, and minimize it otherwise. To stand for what you believe in may sometimes hurt others, but one should never set out to deliberately or carelessly hurt others - that impinges upon their own free will." She could see fire in his eyes as he spoke. He was passionate about this.\par
"Yes, I understand. The intention is not enough. The end doesn't justify the means. You may have all the good intentions in the world, but you have to be very careful not to do evil, thinking you are doing good. You know, the "We are doing this for your own good." brigade."\par
Luke smiled. "History is full of people doing evil in God's name. "The road to hell is paved with good intentions". We discipline children because they do not know what is good for them. Unfortunately many adults are no better than children. It's all about education, informed choice. If someone cannot make an informed decision, then they are still children in that area, no matter how old they might be. But simply telling them what they must do is not enough, they must be taught why that is the right decision. Otherwise they cannot make similar decisions later for themselves.\par
"I am not sure I understand that last bit. You teach a child not to steal. Do you need to explain why? They should never need to decide to steal something. Are you saying that sometimes they might have to decide to steal?"\par
"I believe that you do." Luke began to wave his hands, then stopped and placed his coffee cup carefully on the table. "For example, the child may grow up to be a mother, with no food for her child. Should she steal some? Should she follow what she was taught, and not steal? Then her child may sicken and die. But if she steals some food from a neighbour, then that neighbour may starve instead. An informed choice would mean she was aware of the consequences of her act, and would try to minimize the harm to others if she steals, and to know the consequences to herself and her child if she does not. It is difficult to exercise free will unless you are informed, and can make informed decisions. And to make matters worse, many people who are not informed want to be told what to decide by some authority figure."\par
"Ah, you see things in shades of gray, not black and white." Elanor swallowed down her glass of wine. Luke refilled it for her, emptying the bottle. "I have come around more to that opinion as I grow older. Didn't St Paul write something about spiritual milk for babies?"\par
"I believe he did write something like that. And to continue our example about stealing, not to steal under any circumstances is the milk for babies, and stealing to feed a starving child would be more grown up food. I don't claim to have all the answers though. I mean, why is the mother and child starving in the first place? Did their crops fail? Did God not send rain? Was there a war?"\par
They ordered more coffee, Luke ordered an Armagnac, and they continued talking.\par
Elanor had finished her second coffee and the last glass of wine. She was feeling mellow. "I have sometimes wondered why did God create evil in the first place?"\par
"The problem with free will is that you must have a choice if you are to exercise free will, and so evil must exist for people to be able to choose." Luke replied.\par
"That makes sense. But that doesn't explain famine and plague and all that."\par
Luke shook his head. "Mankind has been trying to explain that away for thousands of years. The lamb doesn't lie down with the lion, unless the lion is dining on the lamb. Is that good or evil? If evil, then does that mean the evil one created this world? If it is good, then what does that say about the god who designed it this way?"\par
"When you put it like that, the world is designed that way. So it has to be good, doesn't it? I mean, we may think of it as evil, it can't be evil can it?"\par
"Once upon a time natural disasters were called 'Acts of God'. I think at the least we have to say the world is as it is. At least the natural part is how it should be. It is neither good nor evil. It is only once we get free will that we are capable of choosing to be evil. I'm sorry, we seem to have strayed far from a simple chat."\par
"I don't mind. You are an interesting person to talk with."\par
"Thank you. You are too." He looked about him. "I think they are closing the restaurant. We should go."\par
They paid their respective bills and walked to the door. Elanor said "I am glad I met you, Luke. I was sad, thinking of the past. But now I am content. I made choices, and I am happy with my choices. You have helped me see that."\par
"You are a good woman, Elanor. I am happy to have helped you. I am glad we have met, and shared this hour."\par
"I hope you don't mind if I do not invite you back to my room, or anything. But I am here for a few more days." Suddenly her heart was fluttering. "I should like to see you again."\par
Luke smiled beatifically. "If you are here tomorrow night, I will be here also. A potential friendship should not be rushed. You do not have far to go?"\par
"No, I am staying in this hotel. I think you are a good man, with principals. I will dine with you tomorrow night here."\par
"Thank you, Elanor. You must decide whether we dine together once I tell you who I am. You cannot pronounce my real name, but you may recognize me when I tell you that Luke is short for Lucifer."\par
It seemed something made her eyes water, and she rubbed them briefly. Did he really say Lucifer? She blinked and looked about her. Luke or Lucifer was nowhere to be seen. She looked around in disbelief. It was as if he had vanished into thin air.\par
